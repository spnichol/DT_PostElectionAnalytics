Folks in business and finance often argue that Donald Trump is "unpredictable." I would argue the complete opposite. 

I view DT as a uniquely habitual individual and hypothesize that his behavior post-election can be partially predicted by patterns in his speech and online writing. 

While much data mining has already been carried out on Mr. Trump, this is the only one I am aware of that combines NLP and computational linguistics to forecast future behavior.
