11/9/2016,Donald Trump ,"New York, NY","Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business. Complicated. Thank you very much.
I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.
I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be President for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.
It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people -- and serve the people it will.
Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.
We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people.
We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people, and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen.
We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships.
No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.
I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone. All people and all other nations.
We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.
And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.
First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. Truly great parents.
I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually.
And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?
My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage, but that's okay. They're great.
And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.
Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.
To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.
This was tough. This political stuff is nasty, and it is tough.
So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.
You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.
And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.
I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?
Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician. Let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get.
Sen. Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?
Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's Ben? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and they are special people.
We have 22 Congressional Medal of Honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is ... that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like Secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.
Reince is really a star and he is the hardest-working guy, and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.
Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.
The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.
And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately. We appreciate them.
So it's been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job, and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you. You will say that -- you will say that that was something that you were -- really were very proud to do and I can — thank you very much.
And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people, and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your President. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.
It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period, and I love this country. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you to Mike Pence."
8/31/2016,Donald Trump ,"Phoenix, AZ","Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad
to be back in Arizona, a state that
has a very special place in my heart.
I love the people of Arizona and,
together, we are going to win the
White House in November.
Tonight is not going to be a normal
rally speech.
Instead, I am going to deliver a
detailed policy address on one of the
greatest challenges facing our country
today: immigration.
I have just landed having returned
from a very important and special
meeting with the President of
Mexico—a man I like and respect
very much, and a man who truly loves
his country. Just like I am a man who
loves the United States.
We agreed on the importance of
ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash,
guns and people across our border,
and to put the cartels out of business.
We also discussed the great contributions
of Mexican-American citizens
to our two countries, my love for
the people of Mexico, and the close
friendship between our two nations.
It was a thoughtful and substantive
conversation. This is the first of what I
expect will be many conversations in a
Trump Administration about creating
a new relationship between our two
countries.
But to fix our immigration system,
we must change our leadership in
Washington. There is no other way.
The truth is, our immigration system
is worse than anyone realizes. But
the facts aren’t known because the
media won’t report on them, the politicians
won’t talk about them, and the
special interests spend a lot of money
trying to cover them up.
Today you will get the truth.
The fundamental problem with the
immigration system in our country
is that it serves the needs of wealthy
donors, political activists and powerful
politicians. Let me tell you who it
doesn’t serve: it doesn’t serve you, the
American people.
When politicians talk about immigration
reform, they usually mean the
following: amnesty, open borders, and
lower wages.
Immigration reform should mean
something else entirely: it should
mean improvements to our laws and
policies to make life better for American
citizens.
But if we are going to make our
immigration system work, then we
have to be prepared to talk honestly
and without fear about these important
and sensitive issues.
For instance, we have to listen to
the concerns that working people have
over the record pace of immigration
and its impact on their jobs, wages,
housing, schools, tax bills, and living
conditions. These are valid concerns,
expressed by decent and patriotic citizens
from all backgrounds.
We also have to be honest about
the fact that not everyone who seeks
to join our country will be able to successfully
assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants
that we think are the likeliest to thrive
and flourish here.
Then there is the issue of security.
Countless innocent American lives
have been stolen because our politicians
have failed in their duty to secure
our borders and enforce our laws.
I have met with many of the parents
who lost their children to Sanctuary
Cities and open borders. They will
be joining me on the stage later today.
Countless Americans who have
died in recent years would be alive
today if not for the open border
policies of this Administration. This
includes incredible Americans like
21-year-old Sarah Root. The man
who killed her arrived at the border,
entered federal custody, and then was
released into a U.S. community under
the policies of this White House. He
was released again after the crime, and
is now at large.
Sarah had graduated from college
with a 4.0, top of her class, the day
before.
Also among the victims of the
Obama-Clinton open borders policies
was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old
convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.
He was murdered by an illegal
immigrant gang member previously
convicted of burglary who had also
been released from Federal Custody.
Another victim is Kate Steinle,
gunned down in the Sanctuary City of
San Francisco by an illegal immigrant
deported five previous times.
Then there is the case of 90 yearold
Earl Olander, who was brutally
beaten and left to bleed to death in his
home. The perpetrators were illegal
immigrants with criminal records who
did not meet the Obama Administration’s
priorities for removal.
In California, a 64 year-old Air
Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was
sexually assaulted and beaten to death
with a hammer. Her killer had been
arrested on multiple occasions, but
was never deported.
A 2011 report from the Government
Accountability Office found
that illegal immigrants and other
non-citizens in our prisons and jails
together had around 25,000 homicide
arrests to their names.
On top of that, illegal immigration
costs our country more than $113 billion
dollars a year. For the money we
are going to spend on illegal immigration
over the next ten years, we could
provide one million at-risk students
with a school voucher.
While there are many illegal immigrants
in our country who are good
people, this doesn’t change the fact
that most illegal immigrants are lowerskilled
workers with less education who
compete directly against vulnerable
American workers, and that these illegal
workers draw much more out from
the system than they will ever pay in.
But these facts are never reported.
Instead, the media and my opponent
discuss one thing, and only this
one thing: the needs of people living
here illegally.
The truth is, the central issue is
not the needs of the 11 million illegal
immigrants—or however many there
may be.
That has never been the central
issue. It will never be the central issue.
Anyone who tells you that the core
issue is the needs of those living here
illegally has simply spent too much
time in Washington.
Only out of touch media elites
think the biggest problem facing
American society today is that there
are 11 million illegal immigrants who
don’t have legal status.
To all the politicians, donors and
special interests, hear these words
from me today: there is only one core
issue in the immigration debate and it
is this: the well-being of the American
people. Nothing even comes a close
second.
Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks
constantly about her fears that families
will be separated. But she’s not talking
about the American families who have
been permanently separated from
their loved ones because of a preventable
death. No, she’s only talking
about families who came here in violation
of the law.
We will treat everyone living or
residing in our country with dignity.
We will be fair, just and compassionate
to all. But our greatest compassion
must be for American citizens.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton
have engaged in gross dereliction
of duty by surrendering the safety of
the American people to open borders.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton
support Sanctuary Cities, they support
catch-and-release on the border, they
support visa overstays, they support
the release of dangerous criminals
from detention—and they support
unconstitutional executive amnesty.
Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty
in her first 100 days, and her plan will
provide Obamacare, Social Security
and Medicare for illegal immigrants—
breaking the federal budget. On top of
that, she promises uncontrolled lowskilled
immigration that continues to
reduce jobs and wages for American
workers, especially African-American
and Hispanic workers. This includes
her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees
in a four-year term.
Now that you’ve heard about
Hillary Clinton’s plan—about which
she has not answered a single substantive
question—let me tell you
about my plan.
While Hillary Clinton meets only
with donors and lobbyists, my plan
was crafted with the input from federal
immigration officers, along with
top immigration experts who represent
workers, not corporations. I also
worked with lawmakers who’ve led on
this issue on behalf of American citizens
for many years, and most importantly,
I’ve met with the people directly
impacted by these policies.
Number One: We will build a
wall along the southern border.
On day one, we will begin working
on an impenetrable physical wall on
the southern border. We will use the
best technology, including above-and
below-ground sensors, towers, aerial
surveillance and manpower to supplement
the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels,
and Mexico will pay for the wall.
Number Two: End
catch-and-release.
Under my Administration, anyone
who illegally crosses the border will be
detained until they are removed out of
our country.
Number Three: Zero tolerance
for criminal aliens.
According to federal data, there are
at least 2 million criminal aliens now
inside the country. We will begin moving
them out day one, in joint operations
with local, state and federal law enforcement. Beyond the 2 million, there are a
vast number of additional criminal
illegal immigrants who have fled or
evaded justice. But their days on the
run will soon be over. They go out,
and they go out fast.
Moving forward, we will issue
detainers for all illegal immigrants
who are arrested for any crime whatsoever,
and they will be placed into
immediate removal proceedings. We
will terminate the Obama Administration’s
deadly non-enforcement policies
that allow thousands of criminal aliens
to freely roam our streets.
Since 2013 alone, the Obama
Administration has allowed 300,000
criminal aliens to return back into
U.S. communities—these are individuals
encountered or identified by ICE
but who not detained or processed for
deportation.
My plan also includes cooperating
closely with local jurisdictions to
remove criminal aliens.
We will restore the highly successful
Secure Communities program. We
will expand and revitalize the popular
287(g) partnerships, which will help
to identify hundreds of thousands of
deportable aliens in local jails. Both of
these programs have been recklessly
gutted by this Administration. This
is yet one more area where we are
headed in a totally opposite direction.
On my first day in office, I am also
going to ask Congress to pass “Kate’s
Law”—named for Kate Steinle—to
ensure that criminal aliens convicted
of illegal reentry face receive strong
mandatory minimum sentences.
Another reform I am proposing
is the passage of legislation named
for Detective Michael Davis and
Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two
law enforcement officers recently
killed by a previously-deported illegal
immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill
will enhance cooperation with state
and local authorities to ensure that
criminal immigrants and terrorists are
swiftly identified and removed.
We are going to triple the number
of ICE deportation officers. Within
ICE, I am going to create a new special
Deportation Task Force, focused
on identifying and removing quickly
the most dangerous criminal illegal
immigrants in America who have
evaded justice.
The local police know who every
one of these criminals are. There’s no
great mystery to it, they’ve put up with
it for years. And now, finally, we will
turn the tables and law enforcement
will be allowed to clear up this dangerous
and threatening mess.
We’re also going to hire 5,000 more
Border Patrol agents, and put more of
them on the border, instead of behind
desks. We will expand the number of
Border Patrol Stations.
I’ve had a chance to spend time
with these incredible law enforcement
officers, and I want to take a moment
to thank them. The endorsement I’ve
received from the Border Patrol officers
means more to me than I can say.
Number Four: Block funding for
sanctuary cities.
We will end the Sanctuary Cities that
have resulted in so many needless
deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate
with federal authorities will not
receive taxpayer dollars, and we will
work with Congress to pass legislation
to protect those jurisdictions that do
assist federal authorities.
Number Five: Cancel
unconstitutional executive
orders and enforce all
immigration laws.
We will immediately terminate President
Obama’s two illegal executive
amnesties, in which he defied federal
law and the constitution to give
amnesty to approximately 5 million
illegal immigrants.
Hillary Clinton has pledged to
keep both of these illegal amnesty
programs—including the 2014
amnesty which has been blocked
by the Supreme Court. Clinton has
also pledged to add a third executive
amnesty.
Clinton’s plan would trigger a Constitutional
Crisis unlike almost anything
we have ever seen before. In effect, she
would be abolishing the lawmaking
powers of Congress in order to write
her own laws from the Oval Office.
In a Trump Administration, all
immigration laws will be enforced.
As with any law enforcement activity,
we will set priorities. But, unlike this
Administration, no one will be immune
or exempt from enforcement—and
ICE and Border Patrol officers will
be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone
who has entered the United States
illegally is subject to deportation—that
is what it means to have laws and to
have a country.
Our enforcement priorities will
include removing criminals, gang members,
security threats, visa overstays,
public charges—that is, those relying
on public welfare or straining the safety
net, along with millions of recent illegal
arrivals and overstays who’ve come
here under the current Administration.
Number Six: We are going to
suspend the issuance of visas
to any place where adequate
screening cannot occur.
According to data provided to the
Senate Subcommittee on Immigration
and the National Interest,
between 9/11 and the end of 2014,
at least 380 foreign-born individuals 
OCTOBER 2016
DONALD TRUMP 289
were convicted in terror cases inside
the United States. The number is
likely higher, but the Administration
refuses to provide this information to
Congress.
As soon as I enter office, I am going
to ask the Department of State, Homeland
Security and the Department of
Justice to begin a comprehensive review
of these cases in order to develop a list
of regions and countries from which
immigration must be suspended until
proven and effective vetting mechanisms
can be put into place.
Countries from which immigration
will be suspended would include
places like Syria and Libya.
For the price of resettling 1 refugee
in the United States, 12 could be resettled
in a safe zone in their home region.
Another reform involves new
screening tests for all applicants that
include an ideological certification to
make sure that those we are admitting
to our country share our values and
love our people.
For instance, in the last five years,
we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants
from Iraq and Afghanistan—in
these two countries, according to Pew
research, a majority of residents say
that the barbaric practice of honor
killings against women are often or
sometimes justified.
Applicants will be asked for their
views about honor killings, about
respect for women and gays and
minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam,
and many other topics as part of the
vetting procedure.
Number Seven: We will ensure
that other countries take their
people back when we order them
deported.
There are at least 23 countries that
refuse to take their people back after
they have been ordered to leave the
United States, including large numbers
of violent criminals. Due to a
Supreme Court decision, if these violent
offenders cannot be sent home,
our law enforcement officers have to
release them into U.S. communities.
There are often terrible consequences,
such as Casey Chadwick’s tragic
death in Connecticut just last year.
Yet, despite the existence of a law that
commands the Secretary of State to
stop issuing visas to these countries,
Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this
law and refused to use this powerful
tool to bring nations into compliance.
The result of her misconduct was
the release of thousands of dangerous
criminal aliens who should have been
sent home.
According to a report from the
Boston Globe, from the year 2008
through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal
aliens were released back into
U.S. communities because their
home countries would not take them
back. Many of these 13,000 releases
occurred on Hillary Clinton’s watch—
she had the power and the duty to
stop it cold and she didn’t do it.
Those released include individuals
convicted of killings, sexual assault
and some of the most heinous crimes
imaginable, who went on to reoffend
at a very high rate.
Number Eight: We will finally
complete the biometric entryexit
visa tracking system.
For years, Congress has required a
biometric entry-exit visa tracking system,
but it has never been completed.
In my Administration, we will
ensure that this system is in place at
all land, air, and sea ports. Approximately
half of new illegal immigrants
came on temporary visas and then
never left. Beyond violating our laws,
visa overstays pose a substantial threat
to national security. The 9/11 Commission
said that this tracking system
should be a high priority and “would
have assisted law enforcement and
intelligence officials in August and
September 2001 in conducting a
search for two of the 9/11 hijackers
that were in the U.S. on expired visas.”
Last year alone, nearly a half a
million individuals overstayed their
temporary visas. Removing visa overstays
will be a top priority of my
Administration. If people around the
world believe they can just come on a
temporary visa and never leave—the
Obama-Clinton policy—then we have
a completely open border. We must
send the message that visa expiration
dates will be strongly enforced.
Number Nine: We will turn off
the jobs and benefits magnet.
We will ensure that E-Verify is used
to the fullest extent possible under
existing law, and will work with Congress
to strengthen and expand its use
across the country.
Immigration law doesn’t exist just
for the purpose of keeping out criminals.
It exists to protect all aspects of
American life—the worksite, the welfare
office, the education system and
much else. That is why immigration
limits are established in the first place.
If we only enforce the laws against
crime, then we have an open border to
the entire world.
I will enforce all of our immigration
laws.
The same goes for government
benefits. The Center for Immigration
Studies estimates that 62 percent of
households headed by illegal immigrants
used some form of cash or noncash
welfare programs, like food stamps
or housing assistance. This directly
violates the federal public charge law
designed to protect the U.S. treasury.
Those who abuse our welfare system
will be priorities for removal.
Number 10: We will reform legal
immigration to serve the best
interests of America and its
workers.
We’ve admitted 59 million immigrants
to the United States between 1965
and 2015.
Many of these arrivals have greatly
enriched our country. But we now have
an obligation to them, and to their children,
to control future immigration—as
we have following previous immigration
waves—to ensure assimilation,
integration and upward mobility.
VSOTD.COM
290 VITAL SPEECHES OF THE DAY
Within just a few years immigration
as a share of national population is set
to break all historical records.
The time has come for a new immigration
commission to develop a new
set of reforms to our legal immigration
system in order to achieve the following
goals:
• To keep immigration levels, measured
by population share, within historical
norms
• To select immigrants based on
their likelihood of success in U.S.
society, and their ability to be financially
self-sufficient. We need a system
that serves our needs—remember, it’s
America First.
• To choose immigrants based on
merit, skill and proficiency
• And to establish new immigration
controls to boost wages and to ensure
that open jobs are offered to American
workers first.
We want people to come into our
country, but they have to come in
legally and properly-vetted, and in
a manner that serves the national
interest.
We’ve been living under outdated
immigration rules from decades ago.
To avoid this happening in the future,
I believe we should sunset our visa
laws so that Congress is forced to periodically
revise and revisit them. We
wouldn’t put our entire federal budget
on autopilot for decades, so why should
we do the same for immigration?
Let’s talk about the big picture
These ten steps, if rigorously followed
and enforced, will accomplish more in
a matter of months than our politicians
have accomplished on this issue
in the last fifty years.
Because I am not a politician,
because I am not beholden to any special
interest, I will get this done for you
and your family.
We will accomplish all of the steps
outlined above, and when we do, peace
and law and justice and prosperity will
prevail. Crime will go down, border
crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear,
and welfare use will decrease.
We will have a peace dividend to spend
on rebuilding America, beginning with
our inner cities.
For those here today illegally who
are seeking legal status, they will have
one route and only one route: to
return home and apply for re-entry
under the rules of the new legal immigration
system that I have outlined
above. Those who have left to seek
entry under this new system will not
be awarded surplus visas, but will have
to enter under the immigration caps
or limits that will be established.
‘. There will be no amnesty.
Our message to the world will be
this: you cannot obtain legal status, or
become a citizen of the United States,
by illegally entering our country.
This declaration alone will help
stop the crisis of illegal crossings and
illegal overstays.
People will know that you can’t just
smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to
be legalized. Those days are over.
In several years, when we have
accomplished all of our enforcement
goals—and truly ended illegal
immigration for good, including the
construction of a great wall, and the
establishment of our new lawful immigration
system—then and only then
will we be in a position to consider the
appropriate disposition of those who
remain. That discussion can only take
place in an atmosphere in which illegal
immigration is a memory of the
past, allowing us to weigh the different
options available based on the new circumstances
at the time.
Right now, however, we are in the
middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis,
and a terrorism crisis. All energies of
the federal government and the legislative
process must now be focused on
immigration security. That is the only
conversation we should be having at
this time.
Whether it’s dangerous materials
being smuggled across the border, terrorists
entering on visas, or Americans
losing their jobs to foreign workers,
these are the problems we must now
focus on fixing—and the media needs
to begin demanding to hear Hillary
Clinton’s answer on how her policies
will affect Americans and their security.
These are matters of life-and-death
for our country and its people, and we
deserve answers from Hillary Clinton.
What we do know, despite the total
lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary
Clinton promises a radical amnesty
combined with a radical reduction in
immigration enforcement. The result
will be millions more illegal immigrants,
thousands more violent crimes,
and total chaos and lawlessness.
This election is our last chance to
secure the border, stop illegal immigration,
and reform our laws to make
your life better.
This is it. We won’t get another
opportunity—it will be too late.
So I want to remind everyone what
we are fighting for—and who we are
fighting for.

8/8/2016,Donald Trump ,"Detroit, MI ","Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. It’s wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America. It’s a conversation about how to Make America Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least. The city of Detroit is where our story begins. Detroit was once the economic envy of the world. The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming. Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished. When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own. The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit. Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense. Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000, about half of the national average. 2 3 40 percent of the city’s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work. Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime—these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent. In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent’s failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton. She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe… and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets…and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity. She is the candidate of the past. Ours is the campaign of the future. This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results. Today, I will outline my economic vision. In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website. Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas. All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production. If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn’t do better than Hillary Clinton’s economic agenda. Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence. The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States. Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards VSOTD.COM 296 VITAL SPEECHES OF THE DAY other countries at our expense. That’s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart. My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first. Here is what an America First economic plan looks like. First, let’s talk tax reform. Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race. Hillary Clinton—who has spent her career voting for tax increases—plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion tax increase. Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent. Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again—to use a now famous term— when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class. I am proposing an across-theboard income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs. The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete. As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers. Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan. Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance. My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process. We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent. For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero. While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity. These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation. We will Make America Grow Again. In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family. It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, povertyinducing Obama-Clinton agenda. The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton’s failed leadership. The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton’s broken promises. She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as senator. But what happened? The Washington Post writes, and I quote: “upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation…. Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton’s first term.” Compare that to my record. In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, “How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,” the paper writes that I—and this is a direct quote— ”waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will—[he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick- starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.” This is what I want to do for our country—I want to jumpstart America. Now let’s look at what the ObamaClinton policies have done nationally. Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt. There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force. It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people. The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans. Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years. Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.Another nearly 7 million Americans were added to the ranks of those in poverty. We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades. 58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed. One in five American households do not have a single member in the labor force. These are the real unemployment numbers—the 5 percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were 16 years ago. The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes. On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent. The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent. It’s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level. In other words, we punish companies for making products in America—but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas. This is backwards. All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States. Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of OCTOBER 2016 DONALD TRUMP 297 their business income in taxes. Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan. Hillary Clinton’s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business. I am going to cut regulations massively. Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country—and into cities like Detroit. To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments. No one will gain more from these proposals than low- and middle-income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas. Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax. This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan. Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death— it’s just plain wrong. We will repeal it. Next comes regulatory reform. As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America. Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is 25 percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980. It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion a year—that’s money taken straight out of cities like yours. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As The Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to 400 new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations—each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down. Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations. My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses. I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs. Those regulations will be eliminated. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win. When I am president, we will. One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform. As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment. We’ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. We’ve seen it in Iran. We’ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in moneylaundered cash as a ransom payment. But we’ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit. Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth. She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA, she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the jobkilling trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Let’s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers. President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who’ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion—resulting in some 70,000 jobs. Like Hillary Clinton’s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Our exports to South Korea haven’t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion—more than doubling our trade deficit with that country. The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Hillary Clinton’s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed. Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP—and it’s also a vote for NAFTA. Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion. Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year. This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton’s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted. Hillary Clinton’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger VSOTD.COM 298 VITAL SPEECHES OF THE DAY disaster for the auto industry. In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs. Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved. That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen. Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests. Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website. It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA. If we don’t get a better deal, we will walk away. At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China. This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy. China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit. They break the rules in every way imaginable. China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property. They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States. Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade. But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers. Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are. Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses. As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will “put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.” We will put our coal miners and steelworkers back to work. Clinton not only embraces President Obama’s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans. According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 per person. A Trump administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country. According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will: • Increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years; • Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades; • Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning. When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American prosperity. We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families. I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts. Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice. We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country. Without security, there can be no prosperity. We must have law and order. In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items. One of my first acts as [resident will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs. We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide—saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country. We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration. This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve. Detroit—the Motor City—will come roaring back. We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past. Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system. OCTOBER 2016 DONALD TRUMP 299 THERE’S NO OTHER DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS IT. Maya Angelou once said, “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” Well, throughout his career and this campaign, Donald Trump has shown us exactly who he is. We should believe him. Address by HILLARY CLINTON, Democratic Nominee for President of the United States Delivered in Reno, Nev., Aug. 25, 2016 The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday—who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday. There will be no change under Hillary Clinton—only four more years of Obama. But we are going to look boldly into the future. We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports that our country deserves. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation. It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy—mined from American sources—that powers this country. It will be American workers who are hired to do the job. Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo. Our country will reach amazing new heights. All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past. We can’t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place. We can’t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them. Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results. We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America. Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn’t be done. America is ready to prove the doubters wrong. They want you to think small. I am asking you to think big. We are ready to dream great things for our country once again. We are ready to show the world that America is back—bigger, and better and stronger than ever before. Thank you, and God Bless You.
